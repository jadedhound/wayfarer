  <h3>Wild Magic</h3>
  <div>
    All spells require a spellcasting check, roll under
    you're class' primary ability score. Spells get harder to control the more powerful they are,
    subtract -2 for each rank above novice from your ability score. If you fail, you can no
    longer cast spells of that rank till youâ€™ve completed a rest and a spell mishap occurs
    (consult the table below to see who it effects).

  <h3>Spell Stipulations</h3>
  <div>
    Spells sometimes have requirements or limitations.<br>
    <span class="font-bold">Resist.</span> The creature rolls the relevant defence check, failure
    means they succumb to the spell.<br>
    <span class="font-bold">Quick.</span> The spell can be cast as a quick action.<br>
    <span class="font-bold">Concentration.</span> You can only concentrate on one spell at a time.
    Taking damage or trying to do another distracting task (such as making a skill check) disrupts
    the spell.

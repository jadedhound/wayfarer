                if you have no dice (might not work on mobile). Do this 6 times. Put the highest in the class specific one: STR for warriors,
                DEX for scoundrels, WIS for zealots and INT for mages. Put the second highest in CON. Distribute
                the rest as you see fit.

                Your speed is 30 ft. and your AC is dependent on the armour your wearing.
                Gambeson: 1, chainmail: 2. If you are holding a shield increase your AC
                by 1. E.g. chainmail + shield = 3 AC. HP is in class basics.

                Have a look at the advancement table. At 1st level you get everything
                in that row: starting HP, equipment and a special skill. Note the skill down
                in your notes (or somewhere for reference).<br>
                If you are a spellcaster (zealot or mage). Choose 2 spells from your
                respective schools (divine or arcane). Have a read of the spellcasting
                stipulations as well.

                You can carry CON amount of items. The first four of these are quick access
                items, which means you can take them in and out of your inventory very quickly.
                The rest of your items is in you backpack.<br>
                Copy the equipment list, do note that 2-handed weapons and chainmail specifically
                take up 2 item slots instead of just 1. Roll on the sundries table (see link below)
                the number of times indicated in the equipment list.<br>
                Every class starts with a: Primitive Lantern. Note this is the last slot labelled lantern.

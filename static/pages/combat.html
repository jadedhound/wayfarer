  <h3>Armour</h3>
  <span class="font-bold">Armour.</span> Each point of armour mitigates 1 point
  of damage. An AC of 3 means you take 3 less damage per hit.<br>
  <span class="font-bold">Sundering.</span> You can destroy armour to reduce
  incoming damage at a rate of [ AC x 5 ].

  <h3>Healing and HP</h3>
  <span class="font-bold">HP.</span> Hit Protection, a measure of how good your
  character is at avoiding damage. Damage taken is first soaked by HP before it
  rolls over to damage/reduce your CON. You regain all HP after a rest.<br>
  <span class="font-bold">CON.</span> Damage to your CON results in noticeable
  damage. Any time you take damage to your CON, you must make a CON check to see
  if you survive the blow. You regain 1 CON per rest.
